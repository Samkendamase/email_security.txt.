Things that show that an email is not legit. 1. The email contains an attachment, banks do not usually send attachments and if they do they will protect the document with a passoword. 2 The email contains words that will make a reader act quickly, "as soon as possible" a bank will give you time if they need you to do something or even ask you to visit their branch. 3 The email contains the word fraud which suggests that it is coming from a fradulent source
The computer is infected by malware since the user opened the attachment, opening documents from suspicious users could infect your computer with malware or viruses. The computer ran slow after a few days later which means it was infected 
Phishing is an act that fraudsters use to trick victims into sharing confidential information such as bank account number, personal information and passwords (Ferreira and Lenzini, 2015). Social engineering is similar to phishing in that it is aimed at making victims share sensitive information, in social engineering fraudsters use phycological tricks such as creating false scenarios that the victim has won money to redeem money they need to put their credentials and passwords (Hadnagy). To avoid falling victim to these cyber crimes always if the email sender is genuin and authentically from the actual sender. Never click on attachments and links especially if they have a sense of urgency. Always update your device software and install antivirus to detect malware before clicking on it. Be very vigilant never claim prives won on competions you never enterd, a;ways browse from the company's websites and not any other side links that randomly appear.
